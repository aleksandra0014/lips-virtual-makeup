## Virtual Lipstic Try-On 
The Virtual Lipstick Try-On project focused on image processing and deep neural networks. I developed a custom U-Net model for lip segmentation using PyTorch, enabling precise identification of lips in images. Following this, I built an application in CustomTkinter to allow users to virtually apply different lipstick shades. Libraries used:
# pytorch, opencv, numpy, pandas, customtkinter
